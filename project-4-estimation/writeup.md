# Project 4: Estimation

## Chris Dalke

In this project, I developed a state estimater for a simulated quadrotor.
The project involves implementing an EKF, which takes in noisy data from sensors to produce an estimation of the true quadcopter position.

## Step 1: Sensor Noise
## Step 2: Attitude Estimation
## Step 3: Prediction Step
## Step 4: Magnetometer Update
## Step 5: Closed Loop + GPS Update
## Step 6: Adding Your Controller
